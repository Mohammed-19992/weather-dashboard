## Title of the App: 
weather-checker

## Overview & Technologies Used:

I created this weather dashboard that helps the user to indicate what the weather looks like in a city they search for. It also shows the next five days's weather forecast. I started with creating a navigation bar that includes the name of the app, which is Weather Checker, and then the body, which includes the search bar, and the dashboard itself, and the cards that show the weather forecast for the next five days of the searched city.

This app is based on the acceptence creteria the user wishes to have, which is:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

Multiple fuinctions are used in this app, and one API from openweathermap.org

jQuery was used in creating this app in addition to the javascript.
